# Steepest-Descent-Algorithm
This code explains gradient descent algorithm with updation in step size for every iteration

This is 2 dimension function X - Y + 2*X^2 + 2*X*Y + Y^2 
which reaches to minima after 19 iterations. 

Step Size varies after every iteration in order to reach minima in the most optimize way.
